# recyclarr_download.sh
Automatically download linux Reyclarr and installs it into /usr/local/bin.
Run as sudo.

# recyclarr.yml
My recyclarr config.\
Merged web-1080p-v4 with web-2160p-v4, that allows me to choose 1080p or 2160p series withing the same Sonarr instance.\
Might merged radarr 1080p and 2160p instances later, maybe dont have to use two instasnces of radarr to download 1080p and 2160p ISOs then.

## outdated, would be nice to cleanup and allow downloading settings from github.
